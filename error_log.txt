Encountered when:
Running convnet.py results in the error after the neural net completes training. Crazy part is
that it creates the first_try.h5 file which should've been AFTER the model trains, is tested
and then saves data. The file is 8.5MB in size.

Note:
When the same file was ran on Utsav's laptop for 1 epoch it completed training but no first_try.h5
file was created.
